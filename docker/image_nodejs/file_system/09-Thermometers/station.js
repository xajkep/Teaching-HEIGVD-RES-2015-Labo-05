/*
 This program simulates a "data collection station", which joins a multicast
 group in order to receive measures published by thermometers (or other sensors).
 The measures are transported in json payloads with the following format:

   {"timestamp":1394656712850,"location":"kitchen","temperature":22.5}

 Usage: to start the station, use the following command in a terminal

   node station.js

*/

// We have defined the multicast address and port in a file, that can be imported both by
// thermometer.js and station.js. The address and the port are part of our simple 
// application-level protocol
var protocol = require('./sensor-protocol');

// We use a standard Node.js module to work with UDP
var dgram = require('dgram');

// Let's create a datagram socket. We will use it to listen for datagrams published in the
// multicast group by thermometers and containing measures
var s = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
s.bind(protocol.PROTOCOL_PORT, function() {
  console.log("Joining multicast group");
  s.addMembership(protocol.PROTOCOL_MULTICAST_ADDRESS);
});

// This call back is invoked when a new datagram has arrived.
s.on('message', function(msg, source) {
	console.log("Data has arrived: " + msg + ". Source IP: " + source.address + ". Source port: " + source.port);
});
